# mtg-card
A project where i recreate a Magic: The Gathering card using HTML &amp; CSS. I plan to recreate this same project scaling the tools that i use, for example: using a framework to split the card in components, to build a card using its info stored in an API... fun stuff.
Card project made with <a href="https://codeburst.io/make-a-magic-the-gathering-card-in-css-5e4e06a5e604">This article</a> by Davide Laiunese.
