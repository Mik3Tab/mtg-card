# mtg-card
A project where i recreate a Magic: The Gathering card using HTML &amp; CSS. I plan to recreate this same project scaling the tools that i use, for example: using a framework to split the card in components, to build a card using its info stored in an API... fun stuff.

I would like to develop something with one of my favourite games, Magic: The Gathering. I've always thought about how I would recreate Magic cards here. It's certainly super entertaining. 

I came across <a href="https://codeburst.io/make-a-magic-the-gathering-card-in-css-5e4e06a5e604">This article</a> by Davide Laiunese. thank you Davide!

I decided to recreate this article as a first contact. In the future, I want to:

  # Recreate cards with a framework such as React or Angular, dividing a generic card model in components.
  # Recreate a deck using a determined number of cards that will use that generic card model.
